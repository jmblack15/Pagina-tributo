         <h2>Family</h2>
         <p>She was the last of the five children of teachers Bronislawa Boguska, and Wladyslaw Sklodowski, who
            taught math and physics classes.</p>

         <h2>Studies</h2>
         <p>When he was ten years old, he began attending J. Sikorska's boarding school; She later attended a
            girls' school, from which she graduated on June 12, 1883 with a gold medal. </p>

         <h2>Marriage to Pierre Curie</h2>
         <p>In 1894 he met Pierre Curie. At that time, the two of them were working in the field of magnetism. At
            35, Pierre Curie was a brilliant hope in French physics. He immediately fell in love with that fine
            and almost austere 27-year-old Polish woman who shared her altruistic faith in science. After Pierre
            proposed to her and convinced her to live in Paris, they celebrated her wedding on July 26, 1895 with
            extreme simplicity: no party, no wedding rings, no white dress. That day the bride wears an ordinary
            blue suit and then, with her boyfriend, rides a bicycle to start the honeymoon on the roads of France.

         <h2>Daughters</h2>
         <p>The marriage had two daughters, one of whom also won a Nobel: Irène Joliot-Curie and her husband,
            Frédéric, received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1935 for obtaining new radioactive elements.</p>

         <h2>What did Marie Curie discover?</h2>
         <p>Marie Curie was interested in the recent discoveries of new types of radiation. Wilhelm Roentgen had
            discovered X-rays in 1895, and in 1896 Antoine Henri Becquerel discovered that uranium emits similar
            invisible radiation. For all this she began to study uranium radiation and, using piezoelectric
            techniques invented by Pierre, she carefully measured the radiation in pitchblende, a mineral that
            contains uranium. When she saw that the radiation from the mineral was more intense than from the
            uranium itself, she realized that there had to be unknown elements, even more radioactive than
            uranium. Marie Curie was the first to use the term 'radioactive' to describe the elements that emit
            radiation when their nuclei decompose.</p>


         <h2>The first female Nobel Prize winner</h2>
         <p>In 1903 they were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery of radioactive elements, which
            they shared with Becquerel. However, for them, this glory is a "disaster"; The two very reserved,
            devoured by the same passion for research, suffer when they are separated from it and when they see
            their laboratory attacked by inopportune people, their modest Parisian pavilion invaded by journalists
            and photographers. To the frivolities that weigh them down, an increasingly voluminous mail is added,
            which they deal with on Sundays. Marie Curie became the first woman to receive this award.</p>

         <h2>Nobel Prize in Chemistry</h2>
         <p>In 1911, Marie starred in a scandal when she established a relationship with the physicist Paul
            Langevin, who was married. Part of the press is launched against the "thief of husbands", "the
            foreigner". This same year she was awarded a second Nobel Prize, Chemistry, for her research on radium
            and its compounds. She was appointed director of the Paris Radio Institute in 1914 and the Curie
            Institute was founded.</p>

         <h2>Death</h2>
         <p>Marie Curie suffered a pernicious anemia caused by long exposures to radiation. After going blind, she
            passed away on July 4, 1934 at the Sancellemoz Clinic, near Passy, Haute-Savoie, France. She was
            buried next to her husband in the Sceaux cemetery, a few kilometers south of Paris.</p>

            <h3>Did you know...</h3>
            <p>Albert Einstein and Curie met in Brussels at the Solvay Conference in 1911. This event brought together
               the world's leading scientists in the field of physics, and Curie was the only woman among its 24
               members.</p>
